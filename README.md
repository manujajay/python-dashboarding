# Python Dashboarding Tools: Streamlit, Dash, and Panel

This README provides detailed instructions and code samples for creating interactive dashboards using three popular Python libraries: Streamlit, Dash, and Panel.

## 1. Streamlit

Streamlit is an open-source app framework specifically designed for Machine Learning and Data Science projects.

### Installation

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

### Sample Code: Basic Dashboard

```python
# app_streamlit.py
import streamlit as st

st.title('Streamlit Dashboard')
st.write("Here's our first attempt at using data to create a table:")
st.write(pd.DataFrame({
    'first column': [1, 2, 3, 4],
    'second column': [10, 20, 30, 40]
}))
```

To run the Streamlit dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run app_streamlit.py
```

## 2. Dash

Dash by Plotly is a powerful framework for building web-based dashboards.

### Installation

```bash
pip install dash==1.19.0  # Adjust version as necessary
```

### Sample Code: Interactive Dashboard

```python
# app_dash.py
import dash
import dash_core_components as dcc
import dash_html_components as html

app = dash.Dash(__name__)

app.layout = html.Div([
    html.H1('Dash Dashboard'),
    dcc.Graph(id='example',
              figure={'data': [
                  {'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [4, 1, 2], 'type': 'bar', 'name': 'SF'},
                  {'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [2, 4, 5], 'type': 'bar', 'name': 'MontrÃ©al'},
              ],
                      'layout': {
                          'title': 'Dash Data Visualization'
                      }}
              )
])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run_server(debug=True)
```

## 3. Panel

Panel works with the tools you know and love from the PyData ecosystem.

### Installation

```bash
pip install panel
```

### Sample Code: Creating Panels

```python
# app_panel.py
import panel as pn
pn.extension()

title = pn.pane.Markdown("# Panel Dashboard", width=800)
table = pn.widgets.DataFrame(pd.DataFrame({
    'A': [1, 2, 3],
    'B': [4, 5, 6]
}), width=400)

dashboard = pn.Row(title, table)

dashboard.show()
```

## Conclusion

Each of these libraries provides unique features for dashboard creation in Python, allowing developers to choose based on their specific needs and the complexity of the data visualization required.
